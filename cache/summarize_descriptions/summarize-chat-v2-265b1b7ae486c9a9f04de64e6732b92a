He is a family man, deeply invested in the well-being and future prospects of his household, which includes his wife, Mrs. Cratchit, and daughters Belinda and Martha, along with Master Peter, for whom he discusses potential job opportunities. This reflects not only his role in the family but also his hopes for their future. Cratchit's character is further highlighted by his participation in festive activities, such as enjoying a slide down Cornhill on Christmas Eve, and his calm demeanor during family gatherings, notably making a statement about the pudding that underscores his presence and role in these intimate moments.\n\nA significant turning point in Cratchit's life is marked by his employer, Scrooge's, promise of a salary raise and assistance for his family, indicating a remarkable change in their relationship.
