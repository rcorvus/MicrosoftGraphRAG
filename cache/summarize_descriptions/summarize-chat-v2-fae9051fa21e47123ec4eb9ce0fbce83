He is a solitary individual living in gloomy chambers that once belonged to his deceased partner, Marley, emphasizing his isolation and connection to the past. Scrooge's skepticism and unsympathetic view towards the poor are evident in his dismissive attitude towards charity and a strong belief in the Poor Law and the Treadmill as sufficient means of support for the poor. He complains about the Christmas holiday and shows ill-will towards holiday celebrations, expressing concern over paying for no work.\n\nScrooge's life takes a significant turn when he encounters the ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley, and other spirits.

Throughout these encounters, Scrooge experiences a range of emotions from reluctance to joy upon revisiting memories of his past, guided by the ghosts. He expresses a desire to see tenderness connected with a death and is led by the Ghost through various scenes, reflecting on his life and the meaning of Christmas.\n\nScrooge's transformation is marked by his profound moment of fear and desperation, leading him to a significant change of heart.
