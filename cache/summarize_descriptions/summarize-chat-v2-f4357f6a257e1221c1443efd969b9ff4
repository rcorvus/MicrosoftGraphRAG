In his spectral form, Marley engages in a significant conversation with Scrooge, revealing his past life and current state as a spirit. He is not only identified as Scrooge's former partner but also as a crucial figure who intervenes in Scrooge's life by sending a second messenger or spirit to further influence Scrooge's path towards redemption.
